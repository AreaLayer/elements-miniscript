//! Pegin Descriptor Support
//!
//! Traits and implementations for Pegin descriptors
//! Note that this is a bitcoin descriptor and thus cannot be
//! added to elements Descriptor. Upstream rust-miniscript does
//! has a Descriptor enum which should ideally have it, but
//! bitcoin descriptors cannot depend on elements descriptors
//! Thus, as a simple solution we implement these as a separate
//! struct with it's own API.
